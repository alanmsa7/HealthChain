## Tools Used
* Hyperledger Composer
* Hyperledger Fabric
* Docker
* Next.JS

## Features
* Allows Doctors to upload patient records and give access to other doctors
* Allows patient to revoke access to doctors in case he doesn't want them to access it
* Our idea also can be extended to insurance providers where they use the private chain to check all the payments and records maintained in order to provide
timely insurance.
